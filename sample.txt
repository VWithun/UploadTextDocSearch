GROWERS’ CEO, Steven Valencsin, founded GROWERS over a decade ago because he saw an opportunity to push technology forward in the ag industry. Steven understands agriculture because he has experienced just about every part of it. He started on the family farm in Washington state and from there ran both a fertilizer tender and a liquid applicator for a farmer-owned retailer, created a soil testing lab after serving in the Navy, and now owns and manages his own farm in Central North Carolina.

Steven is devoted to changing ag through the adoption and advancement of technology. Since it’s founding, GROWERS has grown to over 50 employees who all share the same passion and respect for agriculture. Today, that passion is focused on championing the ag retailer’s role in the increasingly competitive marketplace.
